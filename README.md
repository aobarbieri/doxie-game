# Doxie Dash ![](./images/doxie-sm.png)

In the "Doxie Dash," players take on the role of an adorable, elongated dachshund dog on an exciting adventure. Instead of a snake, our dachshund protagonist explores a whimsical world filled with doggy-themed obstacles and treats. 
The goal is to collect as many treats as you can, survive the longest, and achieve the highest score possible in this delightful canine-themed version of the classic Snake game.
So, grab your virtual leash and embark on this tail-wagging adventure with your dachshund companion!
